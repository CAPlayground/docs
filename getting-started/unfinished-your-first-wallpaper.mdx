## Step 1: Create a New Project

1. Go to your [Projects](https://caplayground.pages.dev/projects) page

## Step 2: Create the Background

1. In the menu bar, select **Floating**. It on the right half of the menu bar.
2. A list saying **Choose Active CA** will appear. Select **Background**. Background appears behind the clock.
3. Add a **Basic layer** in the Layers panel. Set the bounds to the Root Layer's size using the handles on the canvas or the Width anf Height input fields on the Geometry tab of the Inspector panel.
4. On the Inspector panel, go to the **Content** tab and change the Background color to black, for example, **24, 25, 27 (RGB)**, or **#18191b (hex)**.
5. You have just finished the background! The Background CA shows behind the clock.

## Step 3: Create Floating Layers

1. In the menu bar, select **Background**. It on the right half of the menu bar.
2. A list saying **Choose Active CA** will appear. Select **Floating**. Floating layers appear over the clock. Since you did the background in the previous step, you are now doing to floating layers that show over the clock.
3. Create a new **Basic Layer**. In the Inspector panel, go to the **Compositing** tab and set the Corner Radius to 20.
4. You will now decide the 5 colous you will use. I recommend colors that follow a pattern, e.g. a yellow to a red or a blue to a green.
5. Create 4 more layers, each with 20px of corner radius and a different color from the colors that you have picked in step 4.
6. Resize the bounds of each layer except the first one 

5. Position the text in the center of your canvas by dragging it or using the Inspector

## Step 4: Add a Shape

1. Click **Add Layer** â†’ **Basic Layer**
2. A rectangle will appear on your canvas
3. In the Inspector Panel:
   - **Shape**: Circle
   - **Fill**: Choose a color
   - **Size**: Width: 100, Height: 100
   - **Corner Radius**: 50 (makes it perfectly round)

4. Position it somewhere on your canvas

---

## Step 5: Animate the Text

1. Select your text layer
2. In the Inspector Panel, click the **Animations** tab
3. Toggle **Enable animation** to ON
4. Configure the animation:
   - **Key path**: position.y
   - **Duration (s)**: 2
   - **Loop infinitely**: ON
   - **Autoreverse**: ON

5. Add keyframe values:
   - Click **+ Add key value**
   - First value: 0 (moves up)
   - Click **+ Add key value** again
   - Second value: 50 (moves down)

Your text will now smoothly move up and down!

---

## Step 6: Animate the Shape

1. Select your circle layer
2. In the Inspector Panel, click the **Animations** tab
3. Toggle **Enable animation** to ON
4. Configure:
   - **Key path**: transform.rotation.z
   - **Duration (s)**: 3
   - **Loop infinitely**: ON

5. Add keyframe values:
   - First value: 0 (degrees)
   - Second value: 360 (full rotation)

Your circle will now rotate continuously!

## Step 7: Create State Transitions (Optional)

Make your wallpaper react to your device's lock state:

1. In the **States Panel** (bottom right), select **Locked**
2. Move your text layer to a different position
3. Change the opacity of your circle to 0.5
4. Select **Base State** to see the difference

When you lock your device, the wallpaper will transition to the locked state!

<Info>
  State transitions automatically animate smoothly between states. No additional configuration needed!

## Step 8: Export Your Wallpaper

1. Click **Export** in the top menu bar (or press Ctrl+E / Cmd+E)
2. Choose **.tendies** format (recommended for easy application)
3. Save the file to your computer
4. Transfer it to your iOS device
5. Use [PocketPoster](https://github.com/leminlimez/Pocket-Poster) or [Nugget](https://github.com/leminlimez/Nugget) to apply it
