## Troubleshooting

### "Email already exists"

This means an account with that email already exists:
- Try [signing in](/account/signin) instead
- Use the "Forgot Password" option if you don't remember your password

<Info>
  If you signed up with an email, using a third-party provider (Google, GitHub, or Discord) with the same email will connect to the same account.
</Info>

### "Invalid email address"

Make sure you're entering a valid email format:
- Example: `user@example.com`
- Check for typos
- Use a real email address you can access

### "Password too weak"

Your password needs to be:
- At least 6 characters long
- At most 20 characters long

### "Verification email not received"

If you don't receive the verification email:
1. Check your spam/junk folder
2. Wait a few minutes (it may be delayed)
3. Try signing up again with the same email
4. Contact support **support@enkei64.xyz** if the issue persists, or report the issue on the CAPlayground Discord server.
