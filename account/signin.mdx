## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid email or password"

This error means your credentials don't match:

**Solutions:**
- Double-check your email address for typos
- Make sure Caps Lock is off when entering your password
- Try the **Forgot Password** option to reset your password
- If you signed up with a third-party provider, use that provider's button instead

### "Email not verified"

If you signed up with email, you need to verify your email address:

1. Check your inbox for the verification email
2. Click the verification link
3. Try signing in again

**Didn't receive the verification email?**
- Check your spam/junk folder
- Request a new verification email
- Contact support **support@enkei64.xyz** if you still can't find it, or report the issue on the CAPlayground Discord server.

### "Too many attempts"

For security, sign-in attempts are limited:

**Solutions:**
- Wait a few minutes before trying again
- Use the **Forgot Password** option to reset your password
- Clear your browser cache and cookies
- Try a different browser

### "Account not found"

This means no account exists with that email:

**Solutions:**
- Check your email address for typos
- Try signing in with a third-party provider (Google, GitHub, Discord) if you used that method
- [Create a new account](/account/signup) if you haven't signed up yet

### Can't access your email?

If you can't access the email associated with your account:

1. Try signing in with a third-party provider if you linked one (Google, GitHub, Discord)
