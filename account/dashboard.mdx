## Cloud Storage Integration

### Google Drive Sync

CAPlayground supports syncing your projects to Google Drive for additional backup and storage:

**To connect Google Drive:**
1. From the Dashboard, click **Sign in to Google Drive**
2. Authorize CAPlayground to access your Google Drive
3. Then go to the **Projects** page to sync or manage cloud projects

**Benefits:**
- Additional cloud backup
- Access projects from your Google Drive
- You get 15GB of Google Drive storage on the free plan when you create a Google Account (payments aren't part of CAPlayground, they are handled by Google).

**Status:**
- The Dashboard shows whether Google Drive is connected
- "Connected" status appears when successfully linked

<Info>
  Google Drive sync is optional. By default, projects are saved locally on your device (no CAPlayground cloud storage). Your CAPlayground projects are saved with your other Google Drive files.
