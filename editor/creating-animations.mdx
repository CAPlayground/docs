Currently, you can only create the animations that are supported, shown below:
<li>
  - Keyframe Animations
</li>
<h4>Keyframe Animations</h4>
Keyframe animations have a keypath, duration, settings for repeat, and values.

The `keypath` lets you pick what type of keyframe animation you want to create for a layer. You can choose these:
<li>
  - position.x (X axis position movement)
  - position.y (Y axis position movement)
  - transform.rotation.x (X axis rotation)
  - transform.rotation.y (Y axis rotation)
  - transform.rotation.z (Z axis rotation)
</li>
