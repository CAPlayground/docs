Currently, you can only create the animations that are supported, shown below:

- Keyframe Animations

## Keyframe Animations

Keyframe animations have a keypath, duration, settings for repeat, and values.

### Getting Started

**To create a keyframe animation:**

1. Select a layer in your canvas
2. Open the **Animations** tab in the Inspector panel (right side)
3. Toggle **Enable animation** to ON
4. Configure your animation settings (see below)

**Note:** You must be on the **Base State** to create animations. Animations cannot be created or edited in other states.

**Note:** Animations are not supported for video layers.

### Animation Settings

#### Key path

Click the **Key path** dropdown to select what type of animation you want to create for your layer. Available options:

- **position** - Both X and Y axis position movement
- **position.x** - X axis position movement only
- **position.y** - Y axis position movement only
- **transform.rotation.x** - X axis rotation
- **transform.rotation.y** - Y axis rotation
- **transform.rotation.z** - Z axis rotation

#### Duration (s)

Enter a number in the **Duration (s)** input field to set how long it takes to go from one keyframe (Value) to another. For example, if you set a duration of 1, it will take 1 second to go from your first keyframe to the next.

#### Autoreverse

Toggle the **Autoreverse** switch to make your keyframe animation reverse after finishing the last keyframe. This means if you have 5 keyframes, it will go from 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 1.

#### Loop Infinitely

Toggle the **Loop infinitely** switch to control how your animation repeats:

- **When turned ON**: Your animation will repeat forever, going from 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5, then looping again from the first keyframe (1). This works great with **Autoreverse** to create infinitely looping animations that go from 1 → 5 → 1 → 5.

- **When turned OFF**: An input field **Repeat for (s)** will appear below the toggle. Enter the total duration (in seconds) that the animation should play before stopping. For example, if set to 10 seconds, the animation will stop playing after 10 seconds.

#### Values

The **Values** section is where you create the keyframes for your animation. The input fields shown depend on your selected **Key path**:

- For **position**: You'll see X and Y input fields for each keyframe
- For **position.x** or **position.y**: You'll see a single number input for each keyframe
- For **transform.rotation** keypaths: You'll see a Degrees input for each keyframe

**To add a keyframe:**

1. Click the **+ Add key value** button
2. Enter the value(s) for that keyframe in the input field(s)
3. Repeat to add more keyframes

**To remove a keyframe:**

Click the **Remove** button next to the keyframe you want to delete.

**Important:** You MUST have at least 2 values to see an animation. If you only have one value, there's no next keyframe to transition to, so no animation will occur.
