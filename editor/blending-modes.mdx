title: "Blending Modes"
description: "Front-end compositing options available in the Inspector."

The Compositing tab exposes a Blending dropdown used to control how a layer blends with the content beneath it.

## Available Modes

These modes mirror the UI options and map to CSS mix-blend-mode equivalents:

- Normal
- Color
- Color Burn
- Color Dodge
- Darken
- Difference
- Exclusion
- Hue
- Lighten
- Luminosity
- Multiply
- Overlay
- Saturation
- Screen

## Where to find it

- Select a layer
- Open the Compositing tab in the Inspector
- Use the Blending dropdown to choose a mode

## Notes

- Results can vary depending on the colors of underlying layers.
- Some modes are more subtle and depend on the background (e.g., Hue, Saturation, Color, Luminosity).
