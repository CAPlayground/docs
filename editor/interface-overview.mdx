The CAPlayground editor is designed to be intuitive and powerful. Understanding the interface will help you work more efficiently.

## Main Interface Areas

The editor is divided into four main areas:

- **Layers Panel** (left): Manage all your layers
- **Canvas** (center): Visual preview of your wallpaper
- **Inspector Panel** (right): Edit properties of selected layers
- **States Panel** (bottom left): Manage different device states (locked, unlocked, sleep)

### 1. Layers Panel (Left)

The Layers Panel is where you manage all the layers in your wallpaper.

**Features:**
- **Add Layer button**: Click to create new layers (Text, Basic, Gradient, Image, Video, Emitter)
- **Layer list**: Shows all layers in your project in a hierarchical tree
- **Layer actions**: Right-click or use the three-dot menu for options like Rename, Duplicate, Delete
- **Drag and drop**: Reorder layers by dragging them

**Layer Indicators:**
- **Chevron icon** (▶/▼): Indicates a group layer with sublayers; click to expand/collapse
- **Green highlight**: Shows the currently selected layer
- **Layer name and type**: Each layer shows its name and type (e.g., "Basic Layer")

<Tip>
  Double-click a layer name to rename it. Good naming helps you stay organized!
</Tip>

### 2. Canvas (Center)

The Canvas is your visual workspace where you see and interact with your wallpaper.

**Features:**
- **Visual preview**: See your wallpaper exactly as it will appear
- **Direct manipulation**: Click and drag layers to move them
- **Selection handles**: Resize layers by dragging corner or edge handles
- **Rotation handles**: Rotate layers using the rotation handle

**Canvas Controls:**
- **Zoom**: Hold **Shift** and scroll up or down, or use the + and - buttons in the top right corner of the canvas to zoom in/out
- **Pan**: Hold **Shift** and drag to pan around the canvas
- **Grid/Guides**: Snapping helps align layers precisely (configurable in Editor Settings)

<Info>
  The canvas shows your wallpaper at your device's actual resolution. What you see is what you get!
</Info>

### 3. Inspector Panel (Right)

The Inspector Panel shows detailed properties for the selected layer.

**General Tabs (on most layers):**
- **Geometry**: Basic layer properties (position, bounds, rotation, anchor point, etc.)
- **Compositing**: Opacity, corner radius, clip contents
- **Content**: Background color, background opacity, border color, border width
- **Animations**: Keyframe animation settings

<Info>
  Each tab is specific to the layer type. For example, Image layers have an additional **Image** tab for image-specific properties.
</Info>

**Common Properties:**
- **Position (X, Y)**: Layer location on the canvas
- **Bounds (W, H)**: Layer dimensions
- **Rotation (X, Y, Z)**: Layer rotation in degrees
- **Opacity**: Layer transparency
- **Corner Radius**: Rounded corners
- **Background Color**: Layer background fill
- **Border**: Border color and width

<Tip>
  Use the Inspector for precise numeric values. Use the Canvas for quick visual adjustments.
</Tip>

### 4. States Panel (Bottom Left)

The States Panel lets you create a different look for your wallpaper when on different device states, like your device being on the lock screen, home screen, or sleep (off).

**Available States:**
- **Base State**: The default state (just as the default for each state, doesn't exist on device)
- **Locked**: How the wallpaper looks when your device is on the lock screen
- **Unlock**: How the wallpaper looks when your device is on the home screen
- **Sleep**: How the wallpaper looks when your device is off

**How It Works:**
1. Select a state (e.g., "Locked")
2. Modify layer properties (position, opacity, etc.)
3. CAPlayground automatically creates smooth transitions between states

## Menu Bar (Top)

The menu bar provides quick access to important functions:

- **Project Name**: Shows the current project name (click to rename). This is a dropdown that also lets you go back to the Projects page, rename your project, or delete your project.
- **Undo/Redo**: Undo (Cmd/Ctrl+Z) and Redo (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Z)
- **Settings**: Configure editor preferences (snapping options, keyboard shortcuts, etc.)
- **Export**: Export your wallpaper as .CA zip file or .tendies file (Cmd/Ctrl+E)
- **Save Status**: Auto-saves to your device (You can manually save by hovering over the status)

---

## Customizing the Interface

You can customize the editor to fit your workflow:

1. **Resize panels**: Drag the edges between panels to resize them
2. **Collapse panels**: Some panels can be collapsed to give you more canvas space
3. **Settings**: Open Settings (gear icon) to configure:
   - Snap to edges
   - Snap to other layers
   - Snap threshold
   - Show anchor points
   - And more!
