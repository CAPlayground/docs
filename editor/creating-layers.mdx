To create layers, find the 'Add Layer' button in the Layers panel. You can create:

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Text Layer" icon="text">
    A simple layer that contains text
  </Card>
  <Card title="Basic Layer" icon="rectangle">
    A layer that contains a shape
  </Card>
  <Card title="Image Layer" icon="image">
    A layer that contains an image
  </Card>
  <Card title="Video Layer" icon="video">
    A layer that contains a video (30fps, 12s max)
  </Card>
</Columns>

<Warning>
  Video layers can be very resource-intensive when applied in a wallpaper
</Warning>

More layer support will come in the future.
