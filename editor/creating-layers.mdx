Layers are the building blocks of your wallpaper. Each layer represents a visual element like text, shapes, images, or effects.

## How to Create Layers

### Using the Add Layer Button

1. Locate the **Layers Panel** on the left side of the editor
2. Click the **Add Layer** button (with a + icon)
3. Select the type of layer you want to create from the dropdown menu

The new layer will be created and added to your layer list.

### Where Layers Are Created

**By default**, new layers are added:
- **At the top** of the current layer list (in the Base State)
- **As root layers (when no layer is selected)**
- **As sublayers (when a layer is selected)**
- **At the center** of your canvas

<Info>
  Layers higher in the list appear **in front of** layers lower in the list. Think of it like stacking papers on a desk.
</Info>

### Creating Sublayers (a layer inside another layer)

To create a layer as a **sublayer** inside a layer:

1. Select an existing layer you want the sublayer to be created in
2. Create a new layer
3. The layer will become a child of the layer

<Tip>
  Putting layers inside other layers help you organize related elements and apply transformations to multiple layers at once!

### Video Layer

A layer that displays an animated video or GIF.

**Best for:**
- Animated backgrounds
- Moving elements
- GIF animations

**Key features:**
- Supports video files and GIFs

2. Select a video file or GIF from your computer
3. The video will be processed and added to your project

<Warning>
  Video layers can be very resource-intensive when applied as a wallpaper. Use them sparingly for best performance on your device.
</Warning>

<Info>
  GIF files must be imported as Video Layers, not Image Layers. CAPlayground will remind you if you try to upload a GIF as an image.
</Info>

### Emitter Layer

A layer that creates particle effects like snow, rain, sparkles, and more.

**Best for:**
- Particle effects
- Animated backgrounds
- Special effects

**Key features:**
- Multiple emitter shapes (point, line, rectangle, circle, etc.)
- Customizable particles (emitter cells)
- Particle properties (velocity, lifetime, scale, rotation, etc.)
- Render modes (unordered, additive)

**How to create:**
1. Click **Add Layer** → **Emitter Layer**
2. Configure the emitter properties in the Inspector
3. Add and customize emitter cells (particles)

<Tip>
  Emitter layers are advanced! Start with simple effects and experiment to learn how they work.
</Tip>

### Transform Layer (CATransformLayer)

A special container layer for gyro wallpapers that makes sublayers respond to device tilt.

**For:**
- Gyro wallpapers with parallax effects
- Device tilt-responsive designs

**Key features:**
- Responds to device gyroscope (tilting your device can move or rotate the layer.)
- Configurable tilt response (axis, property, range)

**How to create:**
1. Create or open a **gyro wallpaper** project
2. Click **Add Layer** → **Transform Layer**
3. Add sublayers to the transform layer
4. Configure gyro effects in the **Gyro** tab of the Transform Layer.

<Warning>
  Transform Layers are only available in gyro wallpaper projects. They won't appear in the layer menu for regular wallpapers.
</Warning>

## Layer Organization

### Layer Order

The order of layers in the Layers Panel determines their visual stacking:
- **Top of the list** = **Back** of the wallpaper (appears behind)
- **Bottom of the list** = **Front** of the wallpaper (appears on top)

**To reorder layers:**
1. Click and drag a layer in the Layers Panel
2. Drop it above or below other layers
3. A blue line shows where the layer will be placed

<Info>
  Currently, you cannot create empty group layers directly. Create layers first, then organize them into groups by dragging.
</Info>

## Layer Limits

### Performance Considerations

- **Keep it simple**: More layers = more processing power required
- **Optimize images**: Use appropriate image sizes (don't use 4K images if not needed)
- **Limit video layers**: Video layers are the most resource-intensive
- **Limit emitter layers**: Particle effects can impact performance

<Tip>
  Test your wallpaper on your device early and often to ensure good performance!
