## Selecting a Layer

Before you can edit a layer, you need to select it. There are two ways to select a layer:

1. **From the Layers panel** (left side): Click on the layer name in the list
2. **From the Canvas** (center): Click directly on the layer in the preview

When a layer is selected, you'll see:
- A blue highlight around the layer name in the Layers panel
- Selection handles around the layer in the Canvas
- The layer's properties displayed in the Inspector panel (right side)

## Editing from the Inspector

The **Inspector panel** on the right side shows all editable properties for the selected layer. The Inspector is organized into tabs:

### Using Inspector Tabs

Click on the tabs at the top of the Inspector to access different property groups:

- **Properties** - Basic layer properties (position, size, rotation, etc.)
- **Animations** - Keyframe animation settings
- **States** - Layer state configurations
- **Other tabs** - Depending on the layer type

### Editing Properties

**To edit a property value:**

1. Find the property you want to change in the Inspector
2. Click on the input field next to the property name
3. Type the new value or use the arrow keys to increment/decrement
4. Press **Enter** or click outside the field to apply the change

**Common property types:**

- **Number inputs** - Type a number or use arrow keys (e.g., Position X, Position Y)
- **Dropdowns** - Click to open a menu and select an option (e.g., Blend Mode)
- **Toggles/Switches** - Click to turn features on or off (e.g., Enable animation)
- **Color pickers** - Click to open a color selector (for text and shape layers)

## Editing from the Canvas

The **Canvas** provides visual, interactive editing for certain properties:

### Moving Layers

**To reposition a layer:**

1. Click and hold on the layer in the Canvas
2. Drag it to the desired position
3. Release to apply the new position

The Position X and Position Y values in the Inspector will update automatically as you drag.

### Resizing Layers

**To resize a layer:**

1. Select the layer to show selection handles (small squares at the corners and edges)
2. Click and drag a corner handle to resize proportionally
3. Click and drag an edge handle to resize in one direction
4. Release to apply the new size

The Bounds Width and Bounds Height values in the Inspector will update automatically.

**Tip:** Hold **Shift** while dragging a corner handle to maintain the layer's aspect ratio (if supported).

### Rotating Layers

**To rotate a layer:**

1. Select the layer
2. Look for the rotation handle (usually a circular icon or handle)
3. Click and drag the rotation handle to rotate the layer
4. Release to apply the rotation

The Rotation value in the Inspector will update automatically.

## Available Properties

The specific properties you can edit depend on the layer type. Common properties include:

- **Position** (X, Y) - Layer location on the canvas
- **Bounds** (Width, Height) - Layer dimensions
- **Rotation** (X, Y, Z) - Layer rotation in degrees
- **Corner Radius** - Rounded corners for shape layers
- **Opacity** - Layer transparency
- **Blend Mode** - How the layer blends with layers below
- **Animations** - Keyframe animations (see [Creating Animations](/editor/creating-animations))
- And more!

**Note:** Different layer types (Text, Image, Shape, Video, etc.) have different available properties. Refer to the specific layer type documentation for detailed property information.

## Tips

- **Undo/Redo**: Use **Cmd+Z** (Mac) or **Ctrl+Z** (Windows) to undo changes, and **Cmd+Shift+Z** / **Ctrl+Shift+Z** to redo
- **Precision editing**: Use the Inspector for precise numeric values
- **Visual editing**: Use the Canvas for quick, visual adjustments
- **Multiple selections**: Select multiple layers to edit shared properties at once (if supported)
