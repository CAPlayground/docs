To edit a layer, click on it either from the Layers panel or the Canvas, which makes the properties for the layer show in the Inspector. From the inspector, you can edit things like:

<li>
- Position (X, Y)
- Bounds (Width, Height)
- Rotation (X, Y, Z)
- Corner Radius
- Animations (See [this](/editor/creating-animations.mdx))
- More!

</li>
