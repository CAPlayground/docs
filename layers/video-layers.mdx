Video layers display animated videos and GIFs, bringing motion to your wallpapers.

## Creating a Video Layer

1. Click **Add Layer** in the Layers Panel
2. Select **Video Layer…**
3. Choose a video file or GIF from your computer
4. The video will be processed and added to your project

<Info>
  Video processing may take a few moments depending on the file size and length.
</Info>

## Supported Formats

**Video files:**
- MP4
- MOV
- WebM
- Other common video formats

**Animated images:**
- GIF (.gif)

---

## Video Limitations

To ensure good performance on iOS devices, video layers have these limitations:

### Frame Rate
- **Maximum: 30 fps** (frames per second)
- Videos with higher frame rates will be converted to 30 fps

### Duration
- **Maximum: 12 seconds**

### File Size
- Keep video files under 10MB for best performance
- Smaller files = faster loading and better device performance

<Warning>
  Video layers are **very resource-intensive** when applied as wallpapers. Use them sparingly and test on your device to ensure acceptable performance.
</Warning>

## Video Properties

### Frame Count

The total number of frames in the video:
- Automatically calculated when you upload a video
- Read-only (cannot be changed directly)
- Displayed in the **Video** tab

### FPS (Frames Per Second)

The frames per second of the video:
- 30 fps (maximum)

### Duration

The total length of the video in seconds:
- Automatically calculated: `duration = frameCount / fps`
- Maximum: 12 seconds highly recommended

### Auto Reverses

Controls whether the video plays in reverse after reaching the end:

**Off (default):**
- Video plays from start to end
- Loops back to the start
- Example: Frame 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 1 → 2 → ...

**On:**
- Video plays forward, then backward
- Creates a seamless loop
- Example: Frame 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 1 → 2 → ...

**To enable:**
1. Select the video layer
2. In the **Video** tab, find **Auto Reverses**
3. Toggle to ON

<Tip>
  Auto Reverse is great for creating seamless looping animations!
</Tip>

### Calculation Mode

Controls how frames are interpolated:

**Linear (default):**
- Smooth transitions between frames
- Frames blend together slightly

**Discrete:**
- Sharp transitions between frames
- No blending, each frame is distinct
- Better for pixel art or stop-motion style

## Common Properties

Video layers support all standard layer properties:

### Position and Bounds

- **Position (X, Y)**: Location on the canvas
- **Bounds (W, H)**: Dimensions of the video

### Opacity

- **Opacity**: 0% (invisible) to 100% (fully opaque)
- Affects the entire video

### Rotation

- **Rotation Z**: Rotate around the Z-axis (degrees)
- **Rotation X/Y**: 3D rotation effects (advanced)

## Troubleshooting

### "My video won't upload"

**Check:**
- Is the file a supported format? (MP4, MOV, WebM, GIF)
- Is the file size reasonable? (under 50MB)
- Is your internet connection stable?

**Solutions:**
- Try a different video format
- Compress the video
- Try a shorter video

### "Video playback is choppy on my device"

**Solutions:**
- Reduce the **FPS** (try 15 or 20 instead of 30)
- Reduce the video resolution
- Shorten the video duration
- Compress the video file
- Remove other video layers

### "Video looks distorted"

**Solutions:**
- Adjust the layer size to match the video's aspect ratio
- Check that you're not stretching the video

### "Video doesn't loop smoothly"

**Solutions:**
- Enable **Auto Reverses** for automatic seamless loops
- Or edit the video to create a seamless loop (end matches beginning)
- Adjust **FPS** for better timing
- This might just be in the editor, not shown once applied to the device

### "GIF won't upload as an image"

This is expected! GIFs must be uploaded as **Video Layers**:

1. Click **Add Layer** → **Video Layer…**
2. Select your GIF
3. It will be imported as a video layer

## Performance Warning

<Warning>
  **Important:** Video layers are the most resource-intensive layer type. They can significantly impact:
  
  - Battery life on your device
  - Device heat and performance
  - Wallpaper smoothness
  
  **Recommendations:**
  - Use 1 video layer maximum for best performance
  - Test thoroughly on your actual device
  - Consider using animations instead of videos when possible
  - Keep videos short (2-5 seconds)
  - Use lower frame rates (15-20 fps)
</Warning>
