## Text Properties

### Font Family

Choose from available system fonts:

1. Select the text layer
2. In the **Text** tab, find **Font**
3. Click the dropdown to select a font

<Info>
  You may have browser extensions or other software that makes the text render as a different font in the canvas. The canvas uses CSS to render the text, so the font you see in the canvas may not be the same as the font you selected.
</Info>

### Font Size

Control the size of your text:

1. Find **Font Size** in the Text tab
2. Enter a number (in px)
3. Typical sizes: 12-16 (small), 24-36 (medium), 48-72 (large), 100+ (headlines)

**Tips:**
- Larger sizes work better for wallpapers (viewed from a distance)
- Test readability on your actual device

### Text Color

Set the color of your text:

1. Find **Color** in the Text tab
2. Click the color picker
3. Choose a color using:
   - Color wheel
   - Hex code input
   - RGB sliders
   - Other options

**Contrast matters:**
- Light text on dark backgrounds
- Dark text on light backgrounds
- Test visibility in different lighting conditions

### Text Alignment

Align text horizontally within its bounds:

**Options:**
- **Left**: Text aligns to the left edge
- **Center**: Text centers horizontally
- **Right**: Text aligns to the right edge
- **Justified**: Text spreads to fill the width (except last line)

**To set alignment:**
1. Select the text layer
2. Find **Align** in the Text tab
3. Choose your alignment option

### Text Wrapping

Control whether text wraps to multiple lines:

**Options:**
- **Wrapped**: Text wraps within the layer's width
- **No Wrap**: Text stays on one line, extending beyond bounds if needed

**To enable wrapping:**
1. Find **Wrapped** in the Text tab
2. Toggle to **on** or **off**

<Info>
  When wrapping is enabled, make sure your layer's width is wide enough to accommodate your text.
</Info>

## Common Properties

Text layers also support all standard layer properties:

### Position and Bounds

- **Position (X, Y)**: Location on the canvas
- **Bounds (W, H)**: Bounds of the text layer

<Tip>
  For wrapped text, set the width to your desired text column width. The height will determine how much text is visible.
</Tip>

### Opacity

- **Opacity**: Use the slider on the **Compositing** tab to adjust the opacity of the text layer
- Useful for fade-in/fade-out effects with animations

### Rotation

- **Rotation Z**: Rotate text around the Z-axis (degrees)
- **Rotation X/Y**: 3D rotation effects (advanced)

### Layout

**Use alignment:**
- Center-align for headlines and titles
- Left-align for body text and lists
- Right-align sparingly (for special effects)

**Consider wrapping:**
- Enable wrapping for multi-line text
- Disable wrapping for single-line labels
- Set appropriate layer width when wrapping

## Troubleshooting

### "My text is cut off"

**Solutions:**
- Increase the layer's **width** (if wrapping is enabled)
- Increase the layer's **height** (if text is multi-line)
- Reduce the **font size**
- Disable **wrapping** to allow text to extend beyond bounds

### "I can't see my text"

**Check these:**
- Is the text color different from the background?
- Is the opacity > 0%?
- Is the layer visible?
- Is the text layer behind other layers?
- Is there actually text in the layer?

### "The font looks different on my device"

Different devices may render fonts slightly differently. Test on your actual device to ensure it looks as expected.
