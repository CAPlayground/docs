---

Image layers display images from your computer, including photos, illustrations, logos, and icons.

## Creating an Image Layer

### Method 1: Add Layer Menu

1. Click **Add Layer** in the Layers Panel
2. Select **Image Layer…**
3. Choose one or more image files from your computer

### Method 2: Drag and Drop
1. Drag an image file from your computer
2. Drop it onto the canvas
3. An image layer will be created

<Tip>
  You can select multiple images from your computer at once to create multiple image layers quickly!
</Tip>

## Supported Image Formats

CAPlayground supports the following image formats:

- **PNG** (.png) - Best for graphics with transparency
- **JPEG** (.jpg, .jpeg) - Best for photos

<Warning>
  **GIF files** (.gif) must be imported as **Video Layers**, not Image Layers. CAPlayground will show a warning if you try to upload a GIF as an image. GIFs will be turned into videos layers that loop.
</Warning>

## Common Properties

Image layers support all standard layer properties:

### Position and Bounds

- **Position (X, Y)**: Location on the canvas
- **Bounds (W, H)**: Dimensions of the layer bounds

### Opacity

- **Opacity**: 0% (invisible) to 100% (fully opaque)
- Great for overlay effects and blending

### Rotation

- **Rotation Z**: Rotate around the Z-axis (degrees)
- **Rotation X/Y**: 3D rotation effects (advanced)

### Corner Radius

- **Corner Radius**: Round the corners of the image
- Creates circular or rounded rectangle images

### Background and Border

- **Background Color**: Color behind transparent areas
- **Border Color**: Border around the image
- **Border Width**: Thickness of the border

## Best Practices

### Image Size and Resolution

**Optimize for performance:**
- Don't use unnecessarily large images
- Resize images to your canvas dimensions before uploading

**File size:**
- Keep images under 2MB each
- Use JPEG for photos (smaller file size)
- Use PNG for graphics with transparency

### Transparency

**PNG with transparency:**
- Use for logos, icons, and graphics
- Allows layers below to show through
- Slightly larger file size than JPEG

**Removing backgrounds:**
- Remove backgrounds before uploading
- Use tools like Photoshop, GIMP, or online background removers

### Image Quality

**Choose appropriate formats:**
- **Photos**: JPEG (smaller) or PNG (higher quality)
- **Graphics/logos**: PNG or SVG
- **Icons**: PNG or SVG

**Avoid compression artifacts:**
- Use high-quality source images
- Don't over-compress JPEGs

## Advanced Techniques

### Image Masking

Use shapes to mask images:

1. Create an image layer
2. Create a basic layer (e.g., circle) as a container for the image layer, set to 0% opacity
3. Add the image as a sublayer
4. Enable **Clip Contents** on the basic layer
5. The image will be clipped to the shape

## Troubleshooting

### "My image looks stretched or distorted"

**Solutions:**
- Adjust the layer's size to match the image's aspect ratio

### "My image is cropped"

**Solutions:**
- Check that the image isn't larger than the layer bounds

### "I can't see my image"

**Check these:**
- Is the layer's opacity > 0?
- Is the layer visible?
- Is the image behind other opaque layers?
- Is the layer size large enough?
- Did the image upload successfully?

### "My image has a white background (but shouldn't)"

**Solutions:**
- Make sure you uploaded a PNG with transparency
- Check that the original image has transparency
- Remove the background using an image editor before uploading

### "The image quality looks poor"

**Solutions:**
- Upload a higher resolution image
- Use PNG instead of JPEG for graphics
- Avoid over-compressing the image
- Make sure the source image is high quality

### "GIF won't upload as an image"

GIFs are animated and must be uploaded as **Video Layers**, not Image Layers.

1. Click **Add Layer** → **Video Layer…**
2. Select your GIF file
3. It will be imported as an animated video layer
