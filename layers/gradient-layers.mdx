Gradient layers display smooth color transitions between multiple colors, perfect for backgrounds and visual effects.

## Creating a Gradient Layer

1. Click **Add Layer** in the Layers Panel
2. Select **Gradient Layer**
3. A new gradient layer will appear with default colors

---

## Gradient Types

Gradient layers support three gradient types:

### Axial (Linear)

A straight-line gradient from one point to another.

**Best for:**
- Simple backgrounds
- Directional lighting effects
- Top-to-bottom or left-to-right color transitions

**Direction examples:**
- Top to bottom: Start (0.5, 0) → End (0.5, 1)
- Left to right: Start (0, 0.5) → End (1, 0.5)
- Diagonal: Start (0, 0) → End (1, 1)

### Radial

A circular gradient radiating from a center point.

**Best for:**
- Spotlight effects
- Vignettes
- Circular color transitions

**Configuration:**
- **Start Point**: Center of the gradient
- **End Point**: Edge of the gradient (determines radius)

### Conic

A gradient that sweeps around a center point (like a color wheel).

**Best for:**
- Rainbow effects
- Circular color wheels
- Unique artistic effects

**Configuration:**
- **Start Point**: Center of rotation
- **End Point**: Determines the starting angle

## Changing Gradient Type

1. Select the gradient layer
2. Open the **Gradient** tab in the Inspector
3. Find the **Type** dropdown
4. Select: Axial (Linear), Radial, or Conic

## Gradient Properties

### Start Point and End Point

Control the direction and spread of the gradient:

**Coordinate system:**
- Values range from 0% to 100% (sliders in the UI)
- (0%, 0%) = Top-left corner
- (100%, 100%) = Bottom-right corner
- (50%, 50%) = Center

**Common configurations:**

**Axial (Linear):**
- Vertical: Start (50%, 0%) → End (50%, 100%)
- Horizontal: Start (0%, 50%) → End (100%, 50%)
- Diagonal: Start (0%, 0%) → End (100%, 100%)

**Radial:**
- Centered: Start (50%, 50%) → End (100%, 50%)
- Off-center: Start (30%, 30%) → End (100%, 50%)

**Conic:**
- Centered: Start (50%, 50%) → End (50%, 0%)
<Tip>
  Experiment with different start and end points to create unique gradient effects!

## Color Stops

Color stops define the colors in your gradient and where they appear.

### Adding Colors

1. Select the gradient layer
2. In the **Gradient** tab, find the **Colors** section
3. Click **+ Add Color**

### Editing Colors

For each color stop:

**Color:**
1. Click the color picker
2. Choose your color using:
   - Color wheel
   - Hex code input
   - RGB sliders

**Opacity:**
1. Adjust the opacity slider (0% to 100%)
2. 0% = fully transparent
3. 100% = fully opaque

<Info>
  Each color stop has its own opacity, allowing you to create gradients that fade to transparent!
</Info>

### Removing Colors

1. Find the color stop you want to remove
2. Click the **X** button next to it

### Color Stop Order

Colors are distributed evenly along the gradient:
- 2 colors: 0% and 100%
- 3 colors: 0%, 50%, and 100%
- 4 colors: 0%, 33%, 66%, and 100%
- And so on...

<Warning>
  You must have at least 2 colors for a gradient. If you only have 1 color, the gradient won't display properly.
</Warning>

## Common Properties

Gradient layers support all standard layer properties:

### Position and Bounds

- **Position (X, Y)**: Location on the canvas
- **Bounds (W, H)**: Dimensions of the gradient


### Opacity

- **Opacity**: 0% (invisible) to 100% (fully opaque)
- Affects the entire gradient (multiplied with color stop opacities)

### Rotation

- **Rotation Z**: Rotate the gradient around the Z-axis (degrees)

---

## Troubleshooting

### "My gradient isn't showing"

**Check these:**
- Do you have at least 2 colors?
- Are the colors different from each other?
- Is the layer's opacity > 0?
- Are the color stop opacities > 0?
- Is the layer visible?
- Is the gradient behind other opaque layers?

### "The gradient looks banded (not smooth)"

This can happen with:
- Very large gradients
- High-contrast color transitions
- Device limitations

**Solutions:**
- Add intermediate color stops for smoother transitions
- Use closer colors on the color wheel
- Test on your actual device

### "I can't see the difference between gradient types"

**Tips:**
- **Axial**: Look for a straight-line transition
- **Radial**: Look for a circular transition
- **Conic**: Look for a sweeping, color-wheel effect
- Try extreme start/end points to see the difference clearly

### "Start/End points aren't working as expected"

Remember:
- Coordinates are 0% to 100% (not pixels)
- (0%, 0%) = top-left, (100%, 100%) = bottom-right
- For radial gradients, the distance between start and end determines the radius
