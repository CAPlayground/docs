description: "Front-end controls for creating repeated instances of a layer."
---

Replicator layers duplicate a source layer into multiple instances and apply offsets between each instance.

## Creating a Replicator Layer

1. Click Add Layer
2. Select Replicator Layer

---

## Inspector: Replicator Tab

The Replicator tab exposes these properties:

- **Instance Count**
  Number of total instances, including the original. Integer >= 1.

- **Instance Translation**
  Per-instance offset in pixels applied cumulatively.
  - X
  - Y
  - Z

- **Instance Rotation**
  Per-instance rotation offset around the Z axis, in degrees.

- **Instance Delay**
  Delay in seconds between instances for animations. Floating-point, >= 0.

---

## Notes

- Replicator applies the offsets for each successive instance. Small values can create evenly spaced grids or circular arrays when combined with rotation.
- All properties are edited from the Inspector and support direct numeric input and Enter-to-commit, matching the UI behaviour.
