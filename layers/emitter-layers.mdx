Emitter layers create particle effects like snow, rain, sparkles, confetti, and more using Core Animation's particle system.

## Creating an Emitter Layer

1. Click **Add Layer** in the Layers Panel
2. Select **Emitter Layer**
3. A new emitter layer will appear with default settings, without any cells

<Info>
  Emitter layers are **advanced**. Start with simple effects and experiment to learn how they work!

## Understanding Emitter Layers

### What Are Emitter Layers?

Emitter layers generate and animate particles (small visual elements) continuously:

- **Emitter layer**: The layer that holds the emitter cells
- **Emitter Cells**: The particles (what particles look like and how they behave)
- **Particles**: The individual visual elements that are created and animated

**Example:** A snow effect has:
- Emitter layer the same size as the Root Layer
- Emitter cell defining snowflake appearance and falling behavior (geometryFlipped)
- Hundreds of snowflake particles falling down:
  - Birth rate of 10, lifetime of 5 seconds, velocity of 200, emission range of 200, spin of 20, X acceleration of 100, Y acceleration of 200.

## Emitter Layer Properties

### Emitter Position

The location where particles are created:

- **Emitter Position (X, Y)**: Coordinates relative to the layer
- Default: Bottom left corner (or top left if geometryFlipped is enabled)
- Can be different from the layer's position

**To adjust:**
1. Select the emitter layer
2. In the **Emitter** tab, find **Emitter Position**
3. Enter X and Y coordinates

### Emitter Size

The area from which particles are emitted:

- **Emitter Size (W, H)**: Width and height of the emission area
- Larger size = particles spread across a wider area

### Emitter Shape

The shape of the emission area:

**Available shapes:**
- **Point**: Particles emit from a single point
- **Line**: Particles emit along a line
- **Rectangle**: Particles emit from a rectangular area

**To set:**
1. In the **Emitters** tab, find **Shape**
2. Select from the dropdown

### Emitter Mode

Controls how particles are distributed within the shape:

**Volume:**
- Particles emit from anywhere within the shape
- Best for area effects (rain, snow)

**Outline:**
- Particles emit from the edge/perimeter of the shape
- Best for borders and outlines

**Surface:**
- Particles emit from the surface

### Render Mode

Controls how particles are drawn:

**Unordered (default):**
- Particles are drawn in creation order
- Standard rendering

**Additive:**
- Particles blend additively (colors add together)
- Creates glowing, bright effects
- Great for sparkles, fire, magic effects

## Emitter Cells

Emitter cells define what particles look like and how they behave.

### Adding Emitter Cells

1. Select the emitter layer
2. In the **Emitter** tab, find **Emitter Cells**
3. Click **+ Add Cell**
4. Configure the cell properties

<Info>
  You can have multiple emitter cells in one emitter layer to create complex effects!
</Info>

### Removing Emitter Cells

1. Find the cell you want to remove
2. Click the red **Remove** button

### Emitter Cell Properties

Each emitter cell has the following properties:

- **Birth Rate**: How many particles per second (e.g., 10, 50, 100)
- **Lifetime**: How long each particle lives (in seconds)
- **Velocity**: Initial speed of particles
- **Scale**: Size of the particle (e.g., 0.10 = 10% of original size, 1 = original size)
- **Scale Range**: Random variance applied to scale for each particle
- **Scale Speed**: Continuous rate of scale change over particle lifetime
- **Emission Range**: Spread of emission angles (in degrees)
- **Emission Longitude**: Direction angle on the Z axis
- **Emission Latitude**: Direction angle on the X/Y axes
- **Spin**: Rotation speed (degrees per second)
- **Spin Range**: Random variance applied to spin
- **X Acceleration**: Horizontal force applied to particles
- **Y Acceleration**: Vertical force applied to particles
- **Alpha Range**: Random variance to particle opacity
- **Alpha Speed**: Continuous rate of opacity change over lifetime

## Common Properties

Emitter layers support standard layer properties:

### Position and Bounds

- **Position (X, Y)**: Location of the emitter layer on the canvas
- **Bounds (W, H)**: Bounds of the emitter layer

### Opacity

- **Opacity**: 0% (invisible) to 100% (fully opaque)
- Affects all particles from this emitter

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't see any particles"

**Check:**
- Is **Birth Rate** > 0?
- Is **Lifetime** > 0?
- Is the emitter layer visible?
- Are particles being created outside the visible area?

### "Too many/too few particles"

**Adjust:**
- **Birth Rate**: Higher = more particles
- **Lifetime**: Longer = more particles on screen at once

### "Particles move too fast/slow"

**Adjust:**
- **Velocity**: Higher = faster
- **Acceleration**: Adds continuous force

### "Performance is poor"

**Solutions:**
- Reduce **Birth Rate**
- Reduce **Lifetime**
- Remove extra emitter cells
- Simplify particle images
- Test on device to measure actual performance, as browser performance is not representative of device performance.

### "Particles don't look right"

**Check:**
- **Render Mode**: Try Additive for glowing effects
- **Scale**: Adjust particle size
- **Emitter Shape and Size**: Ensure particles emit from the right area

## Performance Warning

<Warning>
  Emitter layers can be resource-intensive, especially with high birth rates or long lifetimes. Always test on your actual device to ensure acceptable performance.
</Warning>
