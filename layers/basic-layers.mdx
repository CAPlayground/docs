Basic layers are square layers that can be styled with background colors, borders, and corner radius to create different visual effects.

## Creating a Basic Layer

1. Click **Add Layer** in the Layers Panel
2. Select **Basic Layer**
3. A new blue rectangle will appear on your canvas

---

## What You Can Create

Basic layers are rectangles, but you can style them to create different shapes:

### Rectangle (Default)

A standard four-sided shape with sharp corners.

### Circle

Create a circle by:
1. Setting **Width** and **Height** to the same value (e.g., 100x100)
2. Setting **Corner Radius** to half the width (e.g., 50 for a 100x100 square)

### Rounded Rectangle

Create rounded corners by setting **Corner Radius** to any value less than half the width/height.

## Layer Properties

### Background Color

The fill color of the layer:

1. Select the basic layer
2. In the **Content** tab, find **Background Color**
3. Click the color picker
4. Choose your color

<Info>
  Background Color fills the entire rectangular area of the layer.
</Info>

### Border

Add an outline around the shape:

**Border Color:**
1. Find **Border** in the Content tab
2. Click the color picker
3. Choose your border color

**Border Width:**
1. Find **Border Width**
2. Enter a number (in pixels)

<Info>
  Set **Border Width** to 0 to remove the border completely.
</Info>

### Corner Radius

Round the corners of the layer:

1. Select a basic layer
2. Find **Corner Radius** in the Compositing tab
3. Enter a value (in pixels)
4. Higher values = rounder corners

---

## Properties Examples

Basic layers support all standard layer properties, these are some you might use:

### Position and Bounds

- **Position (X, Y)**: Location on the canvas (in the Geometry tab)
- **Bounds (W, H)**: Dimensions of the layer (in the Geometry tab)

### Opacity

- **Opacity**: 0% (invisible) to 100% (fully opaque) (in the Compositing tab)
- Affects the entire layer including background and border

### Rotation

- **Rotation Z**: Rotate around the Z-axis in degrees (in the Geometry tab)
- **Rotation X/Y**: 3D rotation effects (advanced)

## Tips

### Creating Circles

1. Set **Width** and **Height** to the same value (e.g., 100x100)
2. Set **Corner Radius** to half that value (e.g., 50)
3. Result: A perfect circle

### Creating Pill Shapes

1. Create a rectangle (e.g., 200x100)
2. Set **Corner Radius** to half the height (e.g., 50)
3. Result: A pill/capsule shape

### Using as Containers

Set **Opacity** to 0% to create an invisible container:
- The layer becomes invisible but can still hold sublayers
- Useful for organizing and grouping other layers
- Move the container to move all sublayers together

<Info>
  For gyro wallpapers, use **Transform Layers (CATransformLayer)** instead of basic layers as containers. Transform Layers enable device tilt effects. [Learn more →](/layers/transform-layers)

## Troubleshooting

### "My circle isn't perfectly round"

Make sure:
- **Width** and **Height** are exactly the same value
- **Corner Radius** is set to half the width/height

### "I can't see my layer"

**Check these:**
- Is the **Background Color** different from the canvas background?
- Is **Opacity** > 0%?
- Is the layer visible (not hidden)?
- Is the layer behind other layers?
- Is the **Bounds** (size) large enough to be visible?

### "Corner radius isn't working"

**Solutions:**
- Check that **Corner Radius** value is > 0
- Ensure the radius isn't larger than half the width/height
- The corner radius is in the **Compositing** tab

### "Border isn't showing"

**Check:**
- Is **Border Width** > 0?
- Is the **Border Color** different from the background color?
- Border settings are in the **Content** tab
