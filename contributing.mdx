# Contributing to CAPlayground

So, you have decided to contribute. If you did this before, to this or other projects, then skip to "Rules".

## How to contribute and become a repeat contributor

To contribute you must have: basic programming skills, the ability to spend time on this and a general joy[^1] for these things.

Step 1: Have GitHub

Step 2: Have a reason to contribute

Step 3: Make your changes, then make a Pull Request. You can find out how to do this on Github Docs.

Step 4: Wait for review, we will carefully review your Pull Request.

And that's it! You are now a contributor. Now you need to do tasks quickly, find bugs, etc.

Optionally: Have Discord and be in the CAPlayground Discord Server mentioned in the Getting Started article. If you do not have Discord then use the Live Chat to ask about it.

## Just contributing, one time only

Alright, you want to contribute but you don't feel like becoming a repeat contributor. 

Follow all the steps in the previous section, but in this case you will need to submit perfect code. Please keep in mind, we have a lot of people willing to help, so your code needs to be the best. 

Anyways, thanks!

Also, you might be given specific things for you to do, like I am a repeat contributor for CAPlayground and I am given the task of writing these docs. You might be given something else like debugging, or anything else along with the other things.

[^1]: This is important, we can't have late contributions. Try to keep a 1 week deadline within being asked a task.
